# 🐍 Python Learning Series

Welcome to my Python Learning Series! This is a personal journey of weekly projects designed to practice and solidify my understanding of core programming concepts using Python. Each week introduces a new topic and project, growing in complexity as I learn.

## 📘 Weekly Projects

### ✅ Week 1: Dungeon Dice
A terminal-based dice game that introduces:

- `print()` and input/output
- Variables
- Loops
- Control flow with `if/elif/else`
- Random number generation

📁 [Dungeon_Game.py](./Dungeon_Game.py)

## 🛠️ Setup & Environment

All projects are managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to handle dependencies cleanly and reproducibly.

To run a project:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python Dungeon_Game.py
```
