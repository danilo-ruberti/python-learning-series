# 🐍 Python Learning Series

Welcome to my Python Learning Series! This is a personal journey of weekly projects designed to practice and solidify my understanding of core programming concepts using Python. Each week introduces a new topic and project, growing in complexity as I learn.

## 📘 Weekly Projects

### ✅ Week 1: Dungeon Dice

A terminal-based dice game that introduces:

- `print()` and input/output
- Variables

- Control flow with `if/elif/else`
- Random number generation

A command-line application that manages a class list. It features:

- Lists to store student data
- Functions to calculate averages, display students, and more

## 🛠️ Setup & Environment

All projects are managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to handle dependencies cleanly and reproducibly.

To run a project:

```bash
poetry install
```
## 🌟 Why This Exists

This project helps track my learning and serve as a living portfolio of hands-on Python work. It’s open source, public, and growing every week!

Feel free to follow along, clone it, or build your own version from it!
